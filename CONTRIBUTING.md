# Contributing

- For submitting new work to the project, create a new branch with one of the following naming formats
  - bugfix/[description]
  - chore/[description]
  - feature/[description]
- Before making and pushing commits be sure to lint your code for any potential errors
  - `npm run lint`
- Many errors (especially formatting errors) can be fixed automatically
  - `npm run lint -- --fix`
- When your work is ready to submit ensure everything is pushed up and then open a [pull request](https://github.com/Open-SGF/portal-to-work-client/pulls).
- After submitting, an admin will review and provide feedback/ask for changes or merge it in.
